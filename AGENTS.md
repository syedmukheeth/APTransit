# AGENTS.md

Rules for every AI coding tool (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot) and every human working on AP TransitOS. Read this file fully before any task.

## Project in one line

AP TransitOS is one connected public transport platform for Andhra Pradesh: citizen web app (PWA), driver app, conductor scanner, depot operations and a government command center, all in one monorepo.

## Read before any task

1. `docs/00-index.md` (map of all docs).
2. Today's prompt in `prompts/day-NN.md`.
3. The docs that prompt lists under "Read first".

The docs in `docs/` are **locked**. Do not edit them during a feature task. If a doc is wrong or missing something, stop, write the question in `progress/decisions-log.md`, and tell the human. A locked doc changes only after both devs agree and the decision is logged.

## Repo layout

```
apps/web          Next.js 16 (citizen, driver, conductor, ops, gov, admin)
apps/api          NestJS 11 (REST + Socket.IO + BullMQ workers)
packages/shared   zod schemas, enums, status map, fare and time helpers (used by web and api)
packages/ui       design tokens + React components
packages/config   eslint, tsconfig, prettier presets
scripts/          repo scripts (check-dashes, simulator, seed helpers)
docs/             locked reference docs
prompts/          daily prompts
progress/         daily log + decisions log
```

## Ownership

| Area | Owner | Reviewer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apps/web`, `packages/ui`, i18n messages | Dev A (frontend) | Dev B |
| `apps/api`, Prisma schema, seeds, infra, CI | Dev B (backend) | Dev A |
| `packages/shared` | Both. Any change needs the other dev's review | Both |

## Hard rules

1. **No em dash or en dash anywhere.** Not in code, comments, UI copy, docs, commit messages or seed data. Use a comma, colon, period, parentheses, or the word "to" for ranges ("06:30 to 12:10"). `pnpm check:dashes` must pass.
2. **No hardcoded UI strings.** Every visible string is a next-intl key in both `apps/web/messages/en.json` and `apps/web/messages/te.json`, added in the same commit.
3. **Tokens only.** No raw hex colours, no arbitrary pixel values, no inline styles. Use the Tailwind theme generated from `packages/ui/src/tokens.css`.
4. **One status system.** Status labels, colours and icons come only from `packages/shared/src/status.ts`. Colour is never the only signal: always show the label and icon too.
5. **Server is the source of truth.** Never trust the client for payment result, ticket status, eligibility, fare, seat availability or location ownership.
6. **Every mutating endpoint** has: zod validation, auth guard, permission check, rate limit, and an audit log entry when listed in `docs/12-security.md`.
7. **Money** is stored as integer paise. **Time** is stored in UTC, shown in `Asia/Kolkata`.
8. **No new dependency** unless it is listed in `docs/04-tech-stack.md`. Need one? Log it in `progress/decisions-log.md` first.
9. **Accessibility is not optional.** WCAG 2.2 AA. Touch targets at least 44 px (56 px in driver and conductor apps). Visible focus ring. Works with keyboard and screen reader.
10. **Every screen has four states:** loading (skeleton), empty, error (with retry), success. See `docs/11-screens.md`.
11. **Business rules are not invented.** If a rule is not in `docs/07-ticket-and-pass-rules.md`, ask. Do not guess fares, refund rates or eligibility.
12. **Check the installed framework docs, not memory.** Next.js 16 ships its own guides in `apps/web/node_modules/next/dist/docs/`. APIs may differ from what an AI tool learned. Read the relevant guide before using a Next.js API you are unsure about.
13. **No secrets in code or logs.** Use `.env` (never committed). Never log OTPs, tokens, payment signatures or full phone numbers outside dev mode.

## Commits and pull requests

- Title only by default. Imperative mood, under 60 characters, no trailing period. Example: `Add seat hold with Redis TTL`.
- Add a body only when the reason is not obvious. Keep it to 1 or 2 short lines.
- **Never** add `Co-authored-by`, `Generated-by`, `AI-assisted` or any AI attribution line, in commits or PR descriptions.
- Before every commit check: no AI attribution, author is the dev's own git account.
- If your editor or AI tool adds co-author trailers automatically, turn that setting off. Do not add git hooks to work around it.
- One feature per branch: `a/<short-name>` for Dev A, `b/<short-name>` for Dev B. Merge to `main` through a PR reviewed by the other dev.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install          # install everything
pnpm dev              # web on :3000, api on :4000
pnpm lint             # eslint + check:dashes
pnpm typecheck        # tsc across the repo
pnpm test             # vitest across the repo
pnpm e2e              # playwright (needs dev servers running)
pnpm db:migrate       # prisma migrate dev (Dev B)
pnpm db:seed          # seed AP demo data
pnpm check:dashes     # fails on U+2014 or U+2013
```

## Definition of done

See `prompts/_shared/definition-of-done.md`. A task is not done until every box is checked and the end of day report is written in `progress/daily-log.md`.
