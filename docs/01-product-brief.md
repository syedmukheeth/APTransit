## What we are building

AP TransitOS is not a booking website. It is one connected digital transport system for Andhra Pradesh that links citizens, buses, drivers, conductors, depots and government.

## Principle

**Make public transport easier without making the app complicated.** The technology can be advanced. The experience stays simple.

- Aim for: simple, fast, clean, reliable, professional.
- Avoid: too many buttons, menus, alerts or details. Complicated booking or ticketing.
- Test for every screen: can a first time user finish the main task without help?

## What success looks like on Day 20

A live demo on staging where:

1. A citizen searches Kurnool to Vijayawada, books seat 18, pays with Razorpay test UPI, gets a ticket and activates it.
2. A driver starts that trip. The simulator moves the bus. The citizen sees it move on the map with ETA.
3. The conductor scans the ticket and sees green VALID within 2 seconds. A second scan shows red ALREADY SCANNED.
4. The driver reports a breakdown. The depot sees it instantly, assigns a replacement bus, and the citizen gets a notification.
5. The government command center shows the incident on the AP map and the numbers for today update.
6. Everything above works in English and Telugu, on a phone and on a laptop.

## Pitch line

Not "just another bus booking app", but one connected digital platform that brings citizens, buses, transport staff and government together.
