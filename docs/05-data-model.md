**Status: LOCKED.** Source: plan sec 57, 68, 69, 70. Owner: Dev B. Dev B writes `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma` from this doc on Day 2.

## Conventions

- Table names `snake_case` plural via `@@map`. Prisma models `PascalCase` singular.
- Primary keys: `id String @id @default(cuid(2))`. Exception: `gps_locations` uses `BigInt @default(autoincrement())`.
- Every table has `createdAt`. Mutable tables also have `updatedAt`.
- Money: `Int` paise, field names end with `Paise`.
- Time: `DateTime` in UTC. Local clock values (timetable departure) stored as `String` `"HH:mm"` in `Asia/Kolkata`.
- Bilingual names: `nameEn`, `nameTe`.
- Human readable codes are unique and indexed: tickets `APT-XXXX-XXXX`, bookings `BKG-XXXXXX`, passes `PAS-XXXXXX`, complaints `CMP-XXXXXX`, incidents `INC-XXXXXX` (Crockford base32, no I, L, O, U).
- Soft delete only for `users` (`deletedAt`). Everything else is status driven.

## Indexes (minimum)

- trips: (routeId, serviceDate), (serviceDate, status)
- route_stops: (stopId)
- tickets: (holderUserId, status), (tripId, status). Seat uniqueness per trip is enforced in the booking transaction plus the Redis hold
- bookings: (userId, createdAt desc)
- gps_locations: (tripId, recordedAt desc)
- incidents: (status, createdAt desc)
- complaints: (status, createdAt desc)
- audit_logs: (entityType, entityId), (actorUserId, createdAt desc)
- stops: (nameEn), (nameTe) for prefix search

## Seat rule (MVP)

A seat is taken for the whole trip, not per segment. Taken means: a ticket on that trip with status BOOKED, ACTIVE, SCANNED or USED, or a live Redis hold. Segment reuse is Phase 2.

## Mapping to plan sec 15 (ticket status)

| Plan status | Our model |
| --- | --- |
| Created, Paid | `bookings.status` PENDING_PAYMENT, then CONFIRMED. No ticket exists before payment is verified (sec 52) |
| Booked | `tickets.status` BOOKED |
| Activated, Valid | ACTIVE. "Valid" is derived: ACTIVE and now is before `validUntil` |
| Scanned | SCANNED |
| Used | USED (set when the trip completes, or at `validUntil` after a scan) |
| Cancelled, Expired, Refunded | CANCELLED, EXPIRED, REFUNDED |

## Retention jobs

| Data | Keep |
| --- | --- |
| gps_locations raw | 30 days, then deleted (daily job) |
| otp_codes | 24 hours |
| refresh_tokens expired or revoked | 30 days |
| notifications | 90 days |
| audit_logs, payments, refunds, tickets, ticket_scans | Kept. Final period decided by the authority ([18](18-open-decisions.md)) |
