# 02 · MVP scope (20 days, 2 developers)

**Status: LOCKED.**

## Reality check

The full plan (113 sections) is a multi month program. In 20 days two developers can ship a **working, demo ready vertical slice of every surface**: citizen, driver, conductor, depot, government, admin. Depth goes to the core journey (search to scan). Everything else is either thin but real, or explicitly out.

## Stretch (only if a day finishes early)

1. Offline conductor scanning with cached public key and trip manifest (sec 77).
2. Driver offline action queue beyond the GPS buffer.
3. Web Push notifications on top of in app and email.
4. Dark mode polish beyond token level.

## Demo story

See "What success looks like on Day 20" in [01-product-brief.md](01-product-brief.md). Every day's work must move one step of that story closer to working on staging.

## Scope guard

If a task is not in the "In scope" table, it is not built in these 20 days. Log the idea in `progress/decisions-log.md` under "Parked".
