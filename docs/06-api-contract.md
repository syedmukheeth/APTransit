# 06 · API contract

**Status: LOCKED.** Source: plan sec 66, 67. Owner: Dev B builds, Dev A consumes. All shapes live as zod schemas in `packages/shared/src/schemas/<area>.ts`.

## Basics

| Item | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Base path | `/api/v1` |
| Web to API | Same origin. `apps/web/next.config.ts` rewrites `/api/v1/:path*` to `API_URL`. Keeps the refresh cookie first party |
| WebSocket | Direct to `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL`, namespace `/live`, token in handshake `auth` |
| Format | JSON, `camelCase` keys, dates as ISO 8601 UTC strings, money as integer paise |
| Auth | `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` (JWT, 15 min). Refresh token in httpOnly cookie `apt_rt`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`, path `/api/v1/auth`, 30 days, rotated on every use |
| Ids | Public ids are cuid2. Never expose sequential ids |
| Idempotency | `POST /bookings`, `POST /payments/verify`, `POST /tickets/:id/activate`, `POST /tickets/:id/transfer` accept `Idempotency-Key` header (uuid). Same key and body returns the first result |
| Pagination | Cursor: `?cursor=<id>&limit=20` (max 100). Response `{ items: [], nextCursor: string or null }` |
| Schema names | `<Thing>Input` for request bodies, `<Thing>Dto` for responses, `<Thing>Query` for query strings |

## Error shape

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "SEAT_TAKEN",
    "message": "Seat 18 is no longer available",
    "details": { "seatNo": "18" },
    "requestId": "req_01J9..."
  }
}
```

- `code` is a stable UPPER_SNAKE value from `packages/shared/src/errors.ts`. The web app shows `t('errors.' + code)`, never `message`.
- HTTP status: 400 validation, 401 no or bad token, 403 role or scope, 404 not found, 409 state conflict, 410 expired, 422 business rule, 429 rate limit, 500 server.

Core error codes: `VALIDATION_FAILED, UNAUTHENTICATED, FORBIDDEN, NOT_FOUND, RATE_LIMITED, OTP_INVALID, OTP_EXPIRED, OTP_TOO_MANY_ATTEMPTS, SEAT_TAKEN, HOLD_EXPIRED, BOOKING_NOT_PAYABLE, PAYMENT_SIGNATURE_INVALID, PAYMENT_AMOUNT_MISMATCH, TICKET_NOT_ACTIVATABLE, TICKET_ALREADY_ACTIVE, ACTIVATION_WINDOW_CLOSED, TICKET_NOT_CANCELLABLE, TICKET_NOT_GIFTABLE, RECIPIENT_NOT_FOUND, GIFT_TO_SELF, PASS_NOT_ELIGIBLE, PASS_ALREADY_ACTIVE, ELIGIBILITY_REQUIRED, DEVICE_NOT_APPROVED, TRIP_NOT_ASSIGNED, TRIP_NOT_STARTABLE, BUS_NOT_AVAILABLE, INTERNAL`.

## Endpoints

Auth column: `public`, `user` (any logged in), or role names from [08](08-roles-permissions.md). Day = the day Dev B ships it.

| `unsubscribe` | `{ room }` | |

Authenticated sockets auto join `user:<userId>`.

| Server emits | Room | Payload |
| --- | --- | --- |

Throttle: at most one `bus:position` per trip per 2 s per room.
