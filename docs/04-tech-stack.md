**Status: LOCKED.** Source: plan sec 55. Only libraries listed here may be installed. Need another one? Log it in `progress/decisions-log.md` first.

## Runtime and tooling

| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | 22 LTS | Both devs already have 22.20 |
| pnpm | 11.x, pinned in root `packageManager` (decision D-001) | Fast, strict workspaces, blocks untrusted install scripts |
| Turborepo | latest 2.x | Task caching, `pnpm dev` runs web and api together |
| TypeScript | latest stable 5.x, `strict: true` | One language end to end |
| ESLint 9 (flat config) + typescript-eslint + eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y | latest | Catch bugs and a11y issues early |
| Prettier | latest | One format, no debates |
| tsx | latest | Run TS scripts (seed, simulator) |
