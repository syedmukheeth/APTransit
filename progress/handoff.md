# Handoff: current state of the repo

**Every AI session and every human starts here.** This is the living "where are we" file. The locked docs in `docs/` say what we are building. This file says what exists today, how it works, and what trips people up.

**Rule:** at the end of every day, the dev who merges last updates the "Current state" section below (it is part of the end of day report). If this file is stale, fix it before starting new work.

Read order for a new session:

1. `AGENTS.md` (hard rules)
2. This file
3. Today's `prompts/day-NN.md`
4. The docs that prompt lists under "Read first"
5. The README of every package you will touch (`apps/api`, `apps/web`, `packages/shared`, `packages/ui`)

## Current state (v2 P2 state model and login email error on main, 2026-10-09)

Work follows `prompts/v2-journey-plan.md`. P1 (minimal UI, D-033) is on main. P2 (State > District, multi state scope, D-034) and the login email error (503 `EMAIL_DELIVERY_FAILED`, D-041) were pushed straight to main on 2026-10-09 at the owner's request, without a PR; the other dev should still review D-034 and D-041 (shared contract changes). Run `pnpm --filter api exec prisma migrate deploy` on every database (two new migrations). Real Gmail login still needs a verified Resend domain, `EMAIL_FROM` and `APP_ENV=staging` on Render, then `OTP_DEV_ECHO=0`. P3 (boarding record and segment validation, D-035) followed the same way: every scan is a boarding record with bus, stop, source, position and validator; ValidateService takes a ValidatorContext so P5 door scanners reuse it; stop checks are skipped when the stop source is NONE. Next: P4 (pass catalog) and P6 (field shell).

**What P2 changed (patterns to copy)**

- A state is data: `states` table, `districts.stateId` required. AP has the fixed id `stateap000000000000000000` (migration and seed agree). `pnpm db:seed --with-tg` adds a Telangana stub and `admin.tg@aptransit.test`.
- Scope lives in one place: `depotScopeWhere`, `isPlatformWide`, `wholeStates` and `ScopeService` (async now) in `apps/api/src/common/services/scope.service.ts`. SUPER_ADMIN is the only platform wide role; STATE_ADMIN and TRANSPORT_OFFICER carry `stateId` on the role and in the JWT. Never write `["STATE_ADMIN", "SUPER_ADMIN", "TRANSPORT_OFFICER"].includes(...)` again.
- Socket room `state:{id}` (the bare `state` room is refused). `LiveRooms` and `TripContext` carry the state; web and API deploy together.
- `PLATFORM_TIME_ZONE` from `@aptransit/shared` everywhere; `rg "Asia/Kolkata" apps packages --glob "!**/generated/**"` should only hit time.ts, schema.prisma defaults, migrations, env and CI config, test names, and `scripts/load/search.ts` (root scripts cannot import the shared package).
- `GET /states` (public) feeds the gov state picker, `/gov/state/[id]`, the breadcrumb root and map `bounds` (MapView, GovMap, OpsMap take `bounds`).
- Checks on this branch: API 434 tests (6 database tests skipped), shared 125, ui 106, web 44; lint, typecheck, i18n, dashes, check:endpoints pass. E2E Desktop Chrome 22 of 22, Pixel 7 22 of 22. Migrations tested as an upgrade on a seeded local database (PGlite): no drift, backfill verified.

**P2 gotchas**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A state admin sees nothing | The role has no `stateId` (state roles need one now) | Grant with `stateId`, or rerun the seed; the backfill migration set AP on existing rows |
| Memory Prisma test fails with "reading 'stateId'" | `TripContext` loads `district.state`, ops reads `route.depot.district.stateId` | Give the fixture `state` and `district` tables and relations (see `test/tracking.test.ts`, `test/day13-ops.test.ts`) |
| `pnpm test` in apps/api times out on a slow laptop | All files in parallel | `pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=2` |
| `next dev` answered 404 for every page during the P2 check (Windows, "slow filesystem" warning) | Not found; the production build of the same code works | Use `pnpm --filter web build` and `start` for browser checks |
| Local API logs "Connection terminated unexpectedly" and health says db down | PGlite socket server allows `--max-connections` (was 10); `nest start --watch` restarts leak pool connections | Start PGlite with `--max-connections=20` and run the API from `dist` (`node apps/api/dist/main.js`) |
| `operations.spec.ts` sometimes fails at the bilingual loop on a slow laptop | The 5 s expect timeout while the page is still loading | Rerun; it passed in the full runs on both projects |
| Map stays on AP for a TG user for a moment | Bounds arrive with `GET /states` | Expected; maps remount when the bounds change |

## Previous state (Days 15 to 20 code done and tested, 2026-10-08)

### Git

| Branch | Contains | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `main` (upstream) | Day 1 to Day 15 (PRs #1 to #6) | Baseline |
| `days-15-16` (fork Saadahmed05/APTransit) | Day 15 fixes, Days 16 to 20 code and docs | Pushed; PR to main and review by the other dev pending |

### Works today (verified locally, Docker Postgres 16 and Redis 7)

- Day 15 fixed: history seed, rollups, gov, analytics, reports and scope (D-030). 18 new indexes (migration 20261007000000_query_indexes).
- Day 16: feedback and ops complaints API (D-031), command center and drill down (state, district, depot, route, trip), live with the simulator.
- Day 17: analytics tabs, reports, feedback screens, complaint handling; CSP with nonce and security headers; log masking; load scripts; docs/12 row map and attacks in the daily log.
- Day 18: retention jobs, health with worker age and queue depth, failed jobs endpoint and summary, MapLibre worker fix (maps were broken in production builds), dropped Tailwind classes fixed, E2E-12 (D-032).
- Day 19: `pnpm check:endpoints` (docs/06 fully matched), E2E-1 to E2E-12 and the route sweep (26 routes, en and te, 360, 768, 1280 px). Final run: Desktop Chrome 17 of 17, Pixel 7 17 of 17, route sweep 5 of 5.
- Neon staging database (project cool-smoke-27052649): migrations applied, base seed and 14 days of history loaded.
- Day 20 docs: progress/demo-script.md, progress/handover.md, progress/phase-2-backlog.md, both app READMEs.
- Checks: API 419 tests (6 database tests skipped), shared 121, ui 47, web 44, lint, typecheck, i18n, dashes.

### Run the whole stack locally

1. `docker run` Postgres 16 on 5432 and Redis 7 on 6379 (see the Day 15 log), `apps/api/.env` pointing at them, `OTP_DEV_ECHO=1`, `PAYMENTS_FAKE=1`.
2. `pnpm --filter api exec prisma migrate deploy`, `pnpm db:seed --history 14` (about 7 minutes locally).
3. `pnpm --filter api build && node apps/api/dist/main.js`, `pnpm --filter web build && pnpm --filter web start`, optionally `pnpm dev:worker`.
4. `E2E_PAYMENTS_FAKE=1 pnpm --filter web exec playwright test --workers=1`, one project at a time (the OTP limit is 10 per IP per hour; locally clear `ratelimit:*` keys in Redis between runs).

### Not done yet

| Item | Why | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Staging (Render api and worker, Vercel, Neon, Upstash), smoke test, v0.2.0 and v1.0.0-demo tags | Upstash, Razorpay, Resend, Render and Vercel accounts pending; Neon is migrated and seeded | After the branch is merged |
| Load tests, headers check, uptime monitor, restore drill, Lighthouse on staging | Need staging | Day 19 on staging |
| Manual QA on real phones, TalkBack and NVDA, native Telugu review, live demo, screenshots | Need people and devices | Day 19 and 20 |

### New gotchas

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Map shows "could not load" only in production | MapLibre 6 worker URL resolved to the page | `apps/web/scripts/copy-map-worker.mjs` plus `setWorkerUrl` (runs before dev and build) |
| A class does nothing and the build is green | Tailwind drops unknown utilities | `pnpm check:classes` after a build |
| Feedback form refuses to send | An empty optional date was sent as "" | FeedbackInput treats "" as no date |
| Validate load gets 429 | 120 scans per conductor per minute (docs/12) | `pnpm load:pool` makes several load conductors |
| Search load gets 429 | 60 per IP per minute | Load from several IPs |
| `createMany` seeds are slow | About 1,000 rows a second | `bulkInsert` with unnest in seed-history.ts |
| A new class does nothing after the P1 refresh | New names: `bg-surface-sunken`, `border-hairline` (not `border-subtle`, that is the text colour), `text-display-lg`, `press-scale`, `animate-enter` | They are in `packages/ui/README.md`; run `pnpm check:classes` after a build |
| `tokens.test.ts` fails after a colour edit | A text pair fell under 4.5:1 or a border under 3:1, or the two dark blocks differ | Fix the value; edit light, dark by system and dark by choice together |
| E2E-3 cannot find a far trip after many runs | Each run moves one trip tomorrow into its activation window | E2E-3 now runs `demo:window <ticket> reset` at the end; `pickTrip` also falls back to the day after |

## How things work

### Build graph (Turborepo)

- `packages/shared` must be **built** before anything imports it (`dist/`). Turbo does it for you: `build`, `dev`, `lint`, `typecheck` and `test` all depend on `^build`.
- `apps/api` runs `generate` (Prisma client) before `build`, `dev`, `lint`, `typecheck` and `test`.
- Changed something in `packages/shared` while `pnpm dev` runs? The shared `dev` task (`tsc --watch`) rebuilds `dist/`. Next picks it up by itself. The API does not (Nest only watches `apps/api/src`): save any file in `apps/api/src` or restart `pnpm dev`. If types look stale in your editor, run `pnpm --filter @aptransit/shared build`.
- `packages/ui` is **not** built. Next compiles it from source (`transpilePackages`).

### API request pipeline

1. `pino-http` gives every request an id: incoming `x-request-id` if it looks safe, else `req_<uuid>`. Sent back in the `x-request-id` header.
2. helmet headers, CORS only for `WEB_ORIGIN` (with credentials), JSON body limit 100 kb, `trust proxy` 1.
3. Global prefix `api/v1`.
4. Controllers. Anything thrown ends in `AllExceptionsFilter`, which always answers the docs/06 shape `{ error: { code, message, details?, requestId } }`. `AppError(code, message, details)` sets the code and the HTTP status from `ERROR_HTTP_STATUS`. 5xx never leak the real message.

### Config

- `src/config/env.ts` is the single list of env vars. `ConfigModule` validates at **import time** of `AppModule`. Missing or bad values stop the boot with a list of variable names (never values).
- Read values with `ConfigService<Env, true>`: `config.get("PORT", { infer: true })`.
- `APP_ENV` (development, staging, production) gates dev only features. `NODE_ENV=test` makes Nest ignore `.env` files in tests.

### Database and Redis

- Prisma 7 with the new `prisma-client` generator, output `src/generated/prisma`, CommonJS. Import with `import { PrismaClient, Prisma } from "../generated/prisma/client"` (relative path from your file).
- `PrismaService` extends the client and uses `@prisma/adapter-pg` with the **pooled** `DATABASE_URL`. The CLI uses the **direct** `DIRECT_URL` from `prisma.config.ts`, which loads `.env` with `process.loadEnvFile`.
- Both Prisma and Redis connect lazily, so the API boots even when they are down. Health tells the truth.
- Redis errors are logged at most once per 30 s (Upstash retries forever otherwise).

### Web styling

- `app/globals.css` imports Tailwind, then `@aptransit/ui/tokens.css`. The tokens file **removes** Tailwind's default palette, font sizes, radii, shadows and easings. Only our tokens exist. See `packages/ui/README.md` for the class list.
- Theme: tokens switch on `data-theme="dark"` on `<html>`, or on the OS preference when there is no `data-theme="light"`. The cookie based theme arrives on Day 3.
- Telugu: any element with `lang="te"` (or inside one) gets 15 percent taller line heights automatically.

## Patterns to copy

### Add an API endpoint (the health module is the template)

1. Request and response zod schemas in `packages/shared/src/schemas/<area>.ts`, exported from `src/index.ts`. Names: `<Thing>Input`, `<Thing>Dto`, `<Thing>Query`.
2. `apps/api/src/modules/<area>/` with `<area>.module.ts`, `<area>.controller.ts`, `<area>.service.ts`, `<area>.service.test.ts`. Register the module in `app.module.ts`.
3. Business failures: `throw new AppError("SEAT_TAKEN", "Seat 18 is no longer available", { seatNo: "18" })`. Only codes from `packages/shared/src/errors.ts`. Need a new code? Add it there with its HTTP status and add the message to both i18n files (Day 3 onwards).
4. Public routes get `@Public()`. Everything else needs login (global `JwtAuthGuard`). Permissions with `@Can`, limits with `@Throttle`, audit with `@Audit` (see `apps/api/README.md`).
5. Inject classes with **value imports** (`import { PrismaService } from ...`), not `import type`, or Nest DI breaks. ESLint already knows this (`nestParserOptions`).
6. Tests: unit tests next to the file; HTTP tests in `apps/api/test/` using `configureHttpApp` like `http.test.ts`, overriding `PrismaService` and `RedisService` when you do not need real ones.
7. Update `docs/06` only through a decision if the built shape differs.

### Add an env var

1. `apps/api/src/config/env.ts` (with a clear error message).
2. `apps/api/.env.example` with a fake value.
3. `apps/api/test/test-env.ts` with a fake value, or every API test fails at import.
4. docs/15 through a decision entry. Tell the other dev to update their `.env`.

### Change the database

1. Edit `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma` (docs/05 is the source of truth).
2. `pnpm db:migrate` (runs `prisma migrate dev` against your own Neon branch) and name the migration.
3. Without a database you can still preview the SQL by diffing the committed schema against yours (run in `apps/api`):
   `git show HEAD:apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma > old.prisma` then `pnpm exec prisma migrate diff --from-schema old.prisma --to-schema prisma/schema.prisma --script`, then delete `old.prisma`. (`--from-migrations` needs a shadow database, so it does not work offline.)
4. Commit the migration folder. Never edit an applied migration.

### Add a UI token or utility

1. Raw value in `packages/ui/src/tokens.css` (light and both dark blocks when it changes by theme).
2. Map it in `@theme inline` (colours) or `@theme` (sizes), or add an `@utility`.
3. If it creates a new class family that could clash (a new font size, z layer, spacing name), register it in `packages/ui/src/cn.ts`, otherwise `cn()` may drop classes silently.
4. Document it in `packages/ui/README.md`.

### React state from the browser

The Next lint config includes the React Compiler rules. `setState` directly inside `useEffect` is an error. Read browser state (theme, media queries, time) with `useSyncExternalStore`, and change things in event handlers. See `apps/web/app/_token-check/token-check.tsx`.

## Gotchas (Day 1 to Day 3)

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` on install | pnpm 11 blocks install scripts | Add the package to `allowBuilds` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (true only if it really needs its script) and log it |
| pnpm adds lines to `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` | pnpm 11 protects against very new releases | Keep them, they are pinned versions we chose |
| `WORKER=1 nest start` fails on Windows | cmd.exe | Already solved: `shellEmulator: true` |
| `pnpm --filter api prisma ...` says no script | pnpm runs scripts, not binaries | `pnpm --filter api exec prisma ...` or the `db:*` scripts |
| All API tests fail with "Invalid environment" | Config validates at import time | Add the new var to `test/test-env.ts` |
| Nest cannot resolve a dependency | Injected class imported with `import type` | Use a value import |
| `cn("text-h1 text-muted")` loses a class | tailwind-merge did not know a token name | Register it in `packages/ui/src/cn.ts` |
| `bg-white`, `text-lg`, `bg-gray-100` do nothing | Defaults removed on purpose | Use tokens (`bg-surface-raised`, `text-body-lg`, `bg-surface`) |
| Horizontal scroll at 360 px in Telugu | Long compound words | Base layer wraps long words; in grids and flex rows add `min-w-0` to text cells |
| `next dev` creates AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md in apps/web | Next 16 writes agent files | Already off: `agentRules: false` |
| Port 3000 or 4000 busy after stopping a server | Windows keeps the child process | `netstat -ano \| findstr :3000` then `taskkill /PID <pid> /F` |
| Prisma prints "Update available 8.x" | Prisma 8 is a release candidate | Ignore, we stay on 7 (D-003). `generate` already hides it |
| CRLF warnings on commit | Global `core.autocrlf` | Harmless: `.gitattributes` stores LF |
| Neon test skipped in `pnpm test` | No `TEST_DATABASE_URL` | Expected until the secret exists |
| A class like `text-text`, `rounded-control`, `border-border-default` does nothing, build still green | Tailwind silently skips names that are not in our theme | Use the names in `packages/ui/README.md` (`text-fg`, `rounded-md`, `border-default`). Check rendered styles in the browser |
| "Functions cannot be passed directly to Client Components" | A server layout passed `icon: Bus` to a client component | Pass `icon: <Bus />` |
| "Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props" | A `packages/ui` component with handlers lacks `"use client"` | Add the directive at the top of the component file |
| Page title "X · AP TransitOS · AP TransitOS" | Nested layout used `title.default` under the root template | Use `title.absolute` in nested layouts |
| React Compiler lint: "This value cannot be modified" on `document.cookie` | Writing a global inside a component | Use `lib/preferences.ts` |
| Web page 401 loops or never refreshes | Calling fetch directly | Always go through `api()` in `lib/api.ts`; pass `redirectOn401: false` for public data |
| `useSearchParams` breaks `pnpm build` (needs Suspense) | Client component on a static page | Read `window.location` in an effect, or take `searchParams` in the server page and pass it down |
| Form reads localStorage and hydration fails | Server and first client render differ | Render the form only after mount (`useSyncExternalStore` mounted flag, see `home-search.tsx`) |
| Local API waits about 4 s per request | No Redis running, commands time out, then fail open | Expected without Upstash. Everything still works |
| Want a real database without Neon | No Postgres on the machine | `npx` PGlite socket server in your scratch folder, point `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` at it, `prisma migrate deploy`, `pnpm db:seed`. Never commit it |
| API test gets 429 unexpectedly | Tests share one IP and the 10 per IP per hour OTP limit | Reset the IP counter in the fake Redis (see `resetIpLimit` in `test/auth.test.ts`) |
| BullMQ `add` fails with "Custom Id cannot contain :" | BullMQ job ids cannot hold a colon | Use a dash (`expiry-<bookingId>`, see `expiryJobId`). Never swallow queue errors silently in tests: the mock queue records `opts` |
| New Lua script works on Upstash but not locally | `scripts/dev-redis.mjs` fakes Lua by matching a marker comment | Start the script with `-- <name>` and add the same behaviour to `runEval` and to the test mock `eval` |
| Local booking takes 3 s | dev-redis cannot run BullMQ, the expiry job add times out | Expected locally. With Upstash the job is scheduled |
| Payment test needs a webhook body | `FakePaymentProvider.webhook(event, paymentId)` signs it like Razorpay | Send it as a raw JSON string with the `X-Razorpay-Signature` header; the app needs `rawBody: true` |
| New code makes tickets | Only `BookingConfirmationService.confirmBooking` may (docs/06) | Call it; never `ticket.create` elsewhere |
| Booking page loses typed names | The draft lives in `lib/booking-draft.ts` (session storage per trip) | Write every change there; read it through `useBookingDraft` (null until hydrated) |
| Dev only route missing locally | `ConfigModule.forRoot` loads `.env` asynchronously and writes validated flags back as "true" | Gate modules with `ConditionalModule.registerWhen` and accept "1" or "true" (see `paymentsFakeEnabled`) |
| Local E2E fails with a 500 from POST /bookings | PGlite with parallel connections can return a null relation | Run Playwright with `--workers=1` locally (CI already does) |
| Need a ticket inside its activation window | Seed trips leave later | `pnpm --filter api demo:window <ticket code> [minutes]` (dev only) |
| `/search` shows From and To instead of place names | The URL has stop ids only; names come from `lib/saved-search.ts` (session storage) | Opening a shared link shows the generic labels. A by id places endpoint would fix it (Dev B) |
| `PlaceCombobox` hydration error on an SSR page | Recent places came from localStorage on the first render | Fixed: read after mount. Do the same for any browser storage read |

## Day 2 notes

### Dev A (design system primitives)

- `packages/ui` has no test setup and no React dependencies yet. Add Vitest, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/user-event`, `@testing-library/jest-dom` and `jsdom` as dev dependencies of `packages/ui` (decision D-010), a `vitest.config.mts` with `environment: "jsdom"`, and a `test` script so Turbo picks it up.
- Radix, `lucide-react`, `class-variance-authority`, `sonner`, `vaul` are allowed by docs/04. Add them to `packages/ui` (not `apps/web`).
- shadcn CLI expects a single app. Easiest: copy each component's source from the shadcn site into `packages/ui/src/components/` and restyle it with our tokens. Never keep shadcn's colour variables (`bg-background`, `text-foreground` and friends do not exist here).
- Components must export from `packages/ui/src/index.ts`. Show them on the Day 1 token page for now (it becomes `/design` on Day 3).
- Anything with state in the browser: follow the `useSyncExternalStore` pattern above.

### Dev B (schema and seed)

- `schema.prisma` has only `Setting`. Add everything from docs/05 in one migration named `schema_v1`, on top of `20260923000000_init`.
- Replace the `db:seed` and `db:reset` placeholders in `apps/api/package.json`. Use `tsx` (allowed by docs/04) and add the seed command to `prisma.config.ts` (`migrations.seed`).
- `db:reset` must refuse to run when `DATABASE_URL` points at the Neon `main` branch.
- New shared files (codes, polyline, time, permissions) go in `packages/shared/src/` with tests and exports in `index.ts`.
- `packages/shared` must stay free of Node only APIs (the web imports it too). Use `Intl` for time zones, not a date library.

## Day 3 notes (done, kept for history)

- Dev A: shells, next-intl with cookie locale, `/design`, 404 and error pages.
- Dev B: OTP auth, refresh rotation, guards, rate limits, audit.
- The review on 2026-09-27 fixed the bugs listed in `progress/daily-log.md` ("Day 03 review").

## Day 4 notes (done, kept for history)

- Dev B: fare.ts, network and search endpoints, apt_session marker (D-016), seed aligned with docs/19 (D-018).
- Dev A: api client and session, proxy guard, home, login, account, OtpInput and DatePicker in packages/ui.

## Day 5 notes (built 2026-10-02)

### Git

Day 5 was completed on `main` directly (owner's request, same as Day 4).

### Dev A (search results, bus details, timetable)

All six items from the prompt are done:

1. `packages/shared/src/format.ts`: `formatTime`, `formatDate`, `formatMoney` (paise in, Indian grouping), `formatDuration`, `formatDistance`, all locale-aware (en/te, Asia/Kolkata). Unit tests added (96 shared tests pass).
2. `TripCard` in `packages/ui/src/components/trip-card.tsx`: departure (large, tabular), service type (i18n key), arrival with approx label, duration, seats-left (ICU plural, warning at 5 or fewer, "Full" + not clickable at 0), fare, StatusBadge when not UPCOMING, free-travel chip. Whole card is one accessible link.
3. `/search` (`apps/web/app/(citizen)/search/`): server page reads params, passes to `SearchClient`. Sticky summary bar (from/to/date, Edit opens Sheet). Time band chips (Morning 05:00-11:59, Afternoon 12:00-16:59, Evening 17:00-20:59, Night 21:00-04:59) stored in URL. Results with skeletons. Empty + Error states. Responsive: filters + search form in left column on md+.
4. `/bus/[tripId]` (`apps/web/app/(citizen)/bus/[tripId]/`): `GET /trips/:id` + `GET /trips/:id/fare`. Shows service type, bus reg, departure/arrival, fare breakdown, seats left, live status, boarding/dropping points, stops timeline. Book ticket (primary, disabled when full or closed), Track bus, View route actions. All 4 states.
5. `/timetable`: districts -> bus stands -> routes breadcrumb. `/timetable/route/[routeId]`: first/last/next bus, frequency, date switcher (Today/Tomorrow/calendar), trip list with StatusBadge, stops list. All from Day 4 endpoints.
6. Responsive on md+. `data-testid` attributes on key elements for E2E.

### Dev B (trip details, seats, holds)

All six items from the prompt are done:

1. Shared schemas in `packages/shared/src/schemas/trips.ts`: `TripDetailDto`, `SeatMapDto`, `FareDto`, `CreateBookingInput`, `BookingDto`, `RefundTierDto`.
2. `GET /trips/:id`, `GET /trips/:id/seats?from&to`, `GET /trips/:id/fare?from&to` (all public). `holdcount:{tripId}` counter key maintained on hold/release. `seatsLeft` in search result subtracts live holds.
3. `POST /bookings`: validates settings, stop order, seat existence and non-blocked state. Atomic Redis hold (SET NX EX) for all seats; rollback on any failure with SEAT_TAKEN. DB transaction for booking + passengers. Idempotency-Key support.
4. `GET /bookings/:id` (owner only), `DELETE /bookings/:id` (owner, PENDING_PAYMENT only: releases holds, CANCELLED).
5. BullMQ: `QueueModule` (producers in API), worker process (WORKER=1). Processors in `apps/api/src/modules/queue/processors/`: `expiry.processor.ts` (booking-hold-expired), `maintenance.processor.ts` (generate-trips daily 00:30 IST).
6. Tests in `apps/api/test/trips-bookings.test.ts`: concurrency (two parallel POST for same seat, exactly 1 succeeds), DELETE releases holds, validation failures. All 116 api tests pass (6 skipped without TEST_DATABASE_URL).

### E2E

- `apps/web/playwright.config.ts`: Desktop Chrome + Pixel 7 profiles.
- `apps/web/e2e/E2E-1-guest-search.spec.ts`: home to search (Kurnool to Vijayawada), results + filter chip URL persistence, open bus details, back keeps filters.
- Run with: `pnpm e2e` (needs dev server on :3000 and API on :4000 with a seeded database).

### Current state (Day 5 complete, 2026-10-02)

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm check:dashes` | PASS |
| `pnpm typecheck` | PASS |
| `pnpm test` | PASS (shared 96, ui 28, web 33, api 116/6 skipped, scripts 6) |
| E2E-1 | Written, requires running servers + seeded DB |

### Not done yet

| Item | Why | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E2E-1 running in CI | Needs Neon test branch + Upstash + seeded data | CI setup |
| Seat selection UI | Not today per prompt | Day 6+ |
| Payment flow | Not today per prompt | Day 10 |
| Upstash usage logged | Needs running Upstash instance | After real .env |
| Worker drain delay verified | Needs BULLMQ_DRAIN_DELAY_SEC in .env | After real .env |

## Day 13 notes

The API validation and conductor manifest contracts are ready for the scanner UI. Use schemas/conductor.ts and earlierScanAt for duplicate scan copy. Keep QR validation on the server; mirror reason labels through both i18n files.
