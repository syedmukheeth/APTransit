# apps/api

NestJS 11 API and background worker for AP TransitOS. Owner: Dev B. Contract: `docs/06-api-contract.md`. Current state and gotchas: `progress/handoff.md`.

## Run

```bash
cp .env.example .env            # fill real values (docs/15). Never commit .env
pnpm --filter api generate      # Prisma client into src/generated/prisma (Turbo also does this)
pnpm db:migrate                 # from the repo root, on your own Neon branch
pnpm dev                        # from the repo root: web :3000 and api :4000
pnpm dev:worker                 # worker process (WORKER=1)
```

Check it: `http://localhost:4000/api/v1/health` answers 200 with `db: "ok"` and `redis: "ok"`. 503 means one of them is unreachable (check `.env`).

Without Neon yet, a local PGlite socket server plus `node scripts/dev-redis.mjs` is enough for search and E2E-1 (data in gitignored `.local/`, Redis on 127.0.0.1:6380). Point `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` at PGlite, then `pnpm db:deploy` and `pnpm db:seed`. The worker still needs real Redis (Upstash) for BullMQ.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `generate` | `prisma generate` (update notice hidden) |
| `build` | `nest build` into `dist/` (`dist/main.js`, `dist/worker.js`) |
| `dev`, `dev:worker` | watch mode for the API or the worker |
| `start`, `start:worker` | run the build |
| `typecheck`, `lint`, `test` | tsc, eslint, vitest |
| `db:migrate` | `prisma migrate dev` |
| `db:deploy` | `prisma migrate deploy` (Render build, docs/17) |
| `db:studio` | Prisma Studio |
| `db:seed` | deterministic AP demo data (`prisma/seed.ts`, docs/19) |
| `db:reset` | wipes and reseeds; refuses the Neon `main` branch and production |
| `db:seed --history 14` | also 14 days of history (trips, bookings, payments, scans, passes, complaints, incidents) and the rollups; reruns replace earlier history |
| `rollups:backfill --days 14` | recompute daily_stats for the last N days |
| `demo:window <ticket> [min]` | development only: move a ticket into its activation window |

Run Prisma directly with `pnpm --filter api exec prisma <command>` (not `pnpm --filter api prisma`).

## Adding a feature module

1. Schemas first: `packages/shared/src/schemas/<area>.ts` (`<Thing>Input`, `<Thing>Dto`, `<Thing>Query`), exported from `packages/shared/src/index.ts`.
2. `src/modules/<area>/<area>.module.ts`, `.controller.ts`, `.service.ts`, `.service.test.ts`. Import the module in `app.module.ts`.
3. Controllers stay thin: validate, call the service, return a Dto. Business rules live in services or dedicated rule files (docs/07 names them).
4. Fail with `throw new AppError("CODE", "Plain message", { detail })`. Codes only from `packages/shared/src/errors.ts`.
5. Inject with value imports (`import { PrismaService } from "../../prisma/prisma.service"`), never `import type`.
6. Every mutating endpoint: validation, auth, permission, rate limit and audit where docs/12 lists them. See "Auth, limits and audit" below.

Minimal controller, copied from health:

```ts
@Controller("health")
export class HealthController {
  constructor(private readonly health: HealthService) {}

  @Public()
  @Get()
  @Header("Cache-Control", "no-store")
  async get(@Res({ passthrough: true }) res: Response): Promise<HealthDto> {
    const report = await this.health.check();
    if (report.status !== "ok") res.status(503);
    return report;
  }
}
```

## Auth, limits and audit

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| No login | `@Public()` on the handler. A valid Bearer token still fills `req.user` |
| Permission | `@Can("ticket:validate")` (names from `packages/shared/src/permissions.ts`), 403 `FORBIDDEN` |
| Scope | inject `ScopeService`, `await assertDepotAccess(user, depotId)`, `await assertDistrictAccess(...)` or `assertStateAccess(user, stateId)` in the service (D-034) |
| Who is calling | `@CurrentUser() user: AuthenticatedUser` (null on public routes without a token) |
| Tighter rate limit | `@Throttle({ default: { limit: 60, ttl: 60_000 } })` from `@nestjs/throttler`. Keyed by user id when logged in, else IP |
| No default limit | `@SkipThrottle()` (health, and auth routes that use `RateLimitService` target limits) |
| Audit row | `@Audit("booking.create")`: written after success, entity id from the response `id` or `:id`. For before and after snapshots call `AuditService.log` |

Rate limits fail open when Redis is down (a cache outage never blocks traffic). OTP attempts are still capped per code in the database.

Seat holds: only through `modules/bookings/seat-holds.ts` (`holdSeats`, `releaseSeats`). Each is one Lua script, so a hold is all or nothing and a release never frees another booking's seat (D-019). Queue job ids must not contain ":" (BullMQ rejects them).

Payments: provider behind `PAYMENT_PROVIDER` (`RazorpayProvider`, or `FakePaymentProvider` when `PAYMENTS_FAKE=1`; tests override it). `POST /payments/test/complete` exists only with `PAYMENTS_FAKE=1` outside production. Tickets are created only in `BookingConfirmationService.confirmBooking`, which is idempotent (D-020). Domain events: inject `DomainEventsService` and `on("booking.confirmed", ...)`. Idempotency-Key: `common/services/idempotency.ts`. Secrets at rest: `common/crypto/secret-box.ts` (AES 256 GCM, `QR_SECRET_KEY`). HTTP tests: `test/fake-redis.ts` knows the Lua scripts.

## Tests

- Vitest with SWC (decorators and metadata). `pnpm --filter api test`.
- `test/setup-env.ts` runs first and loads `testEnv()`. `TEST_DATABASE_URL` and `TEST_REDIS_URL`, when set, replace the fake database and Redis URLs.
- HTTP tests: build the module with `Test.createTestingModule({ imports: [AppModule] })`, override `PrismaService` and `RedisService` with small fakes when the test is not about them, call `configureHttpApp(app)`, then `supertest`.
- Integration tests that need real services use `describe.skipIf(!process.env.TEST_DATABASE_URL)`.
- Services that read a lot of data put the queries in a `<area>.repository.ts` class. HTTP tests then override the repository with an in memory fake (`test/network-fixture.ts`), and a `.int.test.ts` covers the real SQL.
- Raw SQL: Prisma maps camelCase fields to quoted camelCase columns (`t."scheduledDepartureAt"`), tables use the `@@map` names. Compare `serviceDate` with `CAST(${date} AS date)` and read timestamps as `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ...)`, so no time zone guessing happens in the driver.

## Errors and logs

- Response shape: `{ error: { code, message, details?, requestId } }`. The web shows `t("errors." + code)`, never `message`.
- Every response carries `x-request-id`. Quote it when reporting a bug.
- Never log OTPs, tokens, cookies, signatures or full phone numbers. Add new sensitive field names to `REDACT_PATHS` in `src/common/logger.ts`.

Tickets: every rule is in `modules/tickets/ticket-rules.ts` (and `refundQuote` in shared `fare.ts`); services call them, controllers never decide. QR: `QrService` signs `APT1` tokens (Ed25519, `QR_SIGNING_KEY_ID`) and checks rotating codes from `packages/shared/src/qr.ts`. Status changes publish `ticket.status`. Demo: `pnpm --filter api demo:window <ticket code> [minutes]`.

Passes and eligibility (Day 8): rules in `modules/passes/pass-rules.ts`; `PassConfirmationService` is the only code that makes a paid pass READY; `EligibilityProvider` (mock today) never sees or stores an ID number. Free travel tickets are made by `BookingConfirmationService.confirmFreeTravel`.

Notifications (Day 9): call `NotificationsService.notify(userId, type, params, link)`; params are language neutral (`<key>En`, `<key>Te`, ISO times, see `notificationParams` in shared). Emails render in the worker (`NotificationEmailService`). `StatusExpiryService` runs every 5 min on the expiry queue; the worker writes `worker:heartbeat` for `/health`.

Tracking (Day 11): `modules/tracking` (`TripContextService` loads a trip with route, stops and open assignment; `progress.ts` holds the math; `TrackingService` the ping trust checks and live views; `LiveGateway` the `/live` namespace) and `modules/driver`. Services publish `trip.status`, `bus.position`, `incident.created`; only the gateway emits to sockets. Tools: `pnpm simulate --trip <id> --speed 20` and `pnpm watch:live trip:<id>`. Integration tests use `test/memory-prisma.ts` (an in memory Prisma stand in) and `test/fake-redis.ts`.

## Day 12 live tracking and conductor validation

ConductorModule exposes POST /tickets/validate, GET /conductor/today and GET /conductor/trips/:id/manifest. Validation checks the current assignment, signed QR and rotating code before the ordered ticket rules. Every authorized attempt writes a scan and audit record. Tickets use an optimistic version update; pass scans serialize on the pass row. ALREADY_SCANNED includes earlierScanAt. Prisma relationJoins loads only the required ticket/pass relations and prior successful scan together.

Tracking progress persists physically reached stops (150 m), delay changes of at least 2 min, and clamped pace ETA. TripNotificationsService uses durable notification IDs to deduplicate departure, delay bands and boarding proximity. Timing is logged without QR data. The development-only scripts/demo-tracking.ts prepares the seeded driver trip for E2E-7.

## Day 13 operations and manual validation

OpsModule provides scoped dashboard, fleet, trip assignment and replacement, operator cancellation, staff, device and incident endpoints. Permission-specific scope prevents a lower-permission role from widening a mutation. Assignment and fleet changes lock resources before availability checks. Replacement preserves the trip and seats, rejects smaller layouts, notifies holders and publishes domain events. Cancellation creates full-fare refunds including fees; paid tickets move to REFUNDED only on the signed refund webhook. Provider failures persist FAILED refund rows for operations reconciliation.

D-027 manual entry requires ticketNumber plus the current eight-character liveCode. ValidateService reconstructs the signed content from trusted database fields and calls the same QR verifier and ordered rules. Missing, stale and duplicate submissions never bypass existing validation. LiveGateway publishes conductor:counts and incident:update and computes kpi:update every 15 seconds only for occupied operations rooms.

## Day 14

Day 14 adds the guarded admin module for stops, routes, timetables, date-range trip generation, users and scoped roles, fare/refund policy history, validated settings and cursor audit reads. Admin writes persist before/after audit snapshots in the same transaction. Future policy rows do not take effect early. Scoped operations lookup endpoints supply form options. See D-029 and test/day14-admin.test.ts.

## Days 15 to 19

- Analytics, gov and reports read `daily_stats` for past days and compute today with the same code (`RollupsService.rowsForDate`). Levels: route rows have routeId, depot rows depotId, district rows districtId only, one state row has none. Revenue is captured payments minus processed refunds (D-030).
- Scope for staff data: `depotScopeWhere(user, permission)` in `common/services/scope.service.ts`. Only roles that hold the permission count; district officers get the depots of their district, STATE_ADMIN and TRANSPORT_OFFICER the depots of their `stateId`, SUPER_ADMIN everything (`isPlatformWide`). `wholeStates` lists the states a caller sees whole. Never test role names for "statewide" by hand (D-034).
- Time zone: use `PLATFORM_TIME_ZONE` from `@aptransit/shared`; in raw SQL use a parameter or `Prisma.raw` of the constant (see `analytics.service.ts`).
- Reports stream (`ReportsService.lines` is an async generator); CSV has a BOM, ISO dates, IST times and formula injection protection (`reports/csv-helper.ts`).
- Feedback and complaints: `modules/feedback` (public intake with per IP limits, one step status moves, guest emails through the `send-complaint-email` job).
- Worker jobs on the maintenance queue: generate trips 00:30 IST, retention 02:00 IST (10,000 row batches), failed jobs summary 07:00 IST. `GET /health` adds `workerAgeSec` and queue depth; `GET /admin/jobs/failed` lists the last 50 failures.
- Load tests (repo root): `pnpm load:pool` (load conductors on running trips, never production), `pnpm load:validate`, `pnpm load:search`; results in `.local/load`.
- Contract check (repo root): `pnpm check:endpoints` compares controllers with docs/06.
- Bulk inserts in the history seed use `INSERT ... SELECT FROM unnest` (`bulkInsert` in `prisma/seed-history.ts`): createMany manages about 1,000 rows a second.
